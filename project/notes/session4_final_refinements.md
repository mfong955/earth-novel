## Opening Scene Tone Examples

### Horror Opening
```
The thing in my mind felt like claws. Not metaphorical claws—actual claws, sharp and cold, scraping against the inside of my skull. I'd been a park ranger for five years. I'd dealt with bears, rattlesnakes, and tourists who thought flip-flops were appropriate hiking gear. But this? This was different.

The forest had gone quiet. Not peaceful quiet—wrong quiet. The kind of quiet that makes you realize you're prey.

Something was watching me. Something that wanted inside my head.
```

### Comedy After Horror
```
I woke up in the dark, which was problem number one. Problem number two was that I had no idea how I'd gotten there. Problem number three was that my head felt like someone had used it as a drum in a very aggressive metal concert.

"Okay, Lee," I muttered to myself, because talking to yourself in a dark forest is totally normal ranger behavior. "You either had a stroke, or you just had the weirdest day of your life. Let's go with stroke. Strokes are fixable."

My flashlight beam cut through the darkness like a very small, very inadequate sword. If this were a horror movie, this is where I'd die. Good thing this was real life.

...Right?
```

### Paranoia
```
I kept looking over my shoulder. Nothing there. I'd look again. Still nothing. But I could feel it—that prickling sensation between your shoulder blades that says something is absolutely, definitely watching you.

"Hello?" I called out, immediately regretting it. Because that's what you do in horror movies right before you die. "If you're going to murder me, can you at least make it quick? I have a shift tomorrow."

The forest didn't answer. The forest never answers. That's kind of its thing.

But something was out there. And it was following me home.
```
