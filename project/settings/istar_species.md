# The Istar Species

## Overview

The Istars are an ancient species dwelling in the layers beneath Earth's surface. They are long-lived, wise, and powerful in will, having existed for millions of years. They communicate through telepathy and feeling-projections rather than names or spoken language.

## Culture & Society

### Naming Convention
**No Traditional Names**
- Istars don't use names as humans understand them
- Instead, they project a **feeling** that represents their identity
- This feeling-projection is unique to each individual
- Changes and evolves over time as the Istar grows

**Examples of Feeling-Projections:**
- Gandalf: Multi-layered strata building over geological time
- [Other Istars to be developed with their own unique feelings]

**How It Works:**
- Telepathically transmitted
- Conveys essence of the individual
- More information-rich than a name
- Reflects personality, history, and nature
- Evolves as the Istar changes

### Social Structure
- Not hierarchical in traditional sense
- Respect based on age, wisdom, and power
- Different Istars have different roles/missions
- Collaborative but independent
- Elite group of powerful explorers/researchers
- Regular gatherings to share knowledge

### Values

- **Wisdom**: Accumulated over long lifespans
